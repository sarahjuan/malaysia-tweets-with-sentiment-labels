# Malaysian tweets with sentiment labels
This tweet data was extracted from tweets in Malaysia based on keywords "social distancing" and "physical distancing". We conducted sentiment analysis to understand public opinions on health messages during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tweets from January 2020 to July 2021 were extracted using Python module snscrape and sentiments were obtained automatically using Polyglot and MALAYA NLP tools due to multilingual data.

Details on the corpus and experiments can be found in our article (to be published in LNEE):
